# Assignment 1: Generative Kiosk Art

### Getting started

First, ensure that your Raspberry Pi has [internet access](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md).
Depending on your text editor and environment preferences, 
either connect your Pi to a monitor, 
or [ssh into it](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-6-using-ssh/enabling-ssh) to do local development.

### Processing/monitor setup

Install Processing on your Pi:
```$ curl https://processing.org/download/install-arm.sh | sudo sh ```


### Python/LED setup

Ensure that Python3 is installed on your Pi:
```$ python3 --version```
